# play-scala-slick-example

This project demonstrates how to create a simple CRUD application with [Play](https://www.playframework.com/) and
[Slick](https://scala-slick.org/) using
[Play-Slick](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/latest/PlaySlick).

To run the projects in this sample:

```bash
# Open the SBT shell
sbt 
# Once in the SBT shell list the projects
projects
# Select a project
project basic-sample
# Start the play dev server
run
```

To see an example of a Play application using Slick outside the play application lifecycle, please see:
